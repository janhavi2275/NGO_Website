ABOUT US

नवीन्य - एक नई शुरुआत का वादा
A Promise of New Beginnings
```

**Body Text**:
```
Navinya Foundation was born from a simple belief: every child, every woman, 
every family in rural Maharashtra deserves access to opportunities that can 
transform their lives. Founded in 2022 by a group of educators and social 
workers who witnessed firsthand the struggles of talented students held back 
by poverty, we set out to bridge the gap between potential and possibility.

Today, we work across 7 key areas - from education and women empowerment 
to rural development and environmental sustainability. Our approach is 
holistic: we don't just provide scholarships, we create ecosystems of support 
that help entire communities rise together.

What makes us different? We combine grassroots understanding with modern 
technology, traditional wisdom with innovative solutions, and most importantly - 
we measure every rupee's impact. Because we believe that transparency and 
results are the foundation of trust.
