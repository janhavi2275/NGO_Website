## OVERVIEW

**Headline**: `Transforming Lives Through Education`

**Content**:
```
Education is the most powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty. Yet, thousands of 
brilliant students in rural Maharashtra are forced to abandon their dreams due to financial 
constraints. At Navinya Foundation, we believe every child deserves access to quality education 
- regardless of their economic background.

Our education programs go beyond just scholarships. We provide comprehensive support including 
coaching, digital learning infrastructure, mentorship, and career guidance to ensure students 
don't just enroll in courses, but actually succeed and thrive.
