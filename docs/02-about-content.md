Our Story - How It All Began
```

**Body Text**:
```
In 2022, a group of educators and social workers gathered in a small room in Shirpur, 
Maharashtra. They had all witnessed the same heartbreaking pattern: brilliant students 
from rural areas forced to abandon their education due to poverty, talented women with 
no opportunities to showcase their skills, and villages struggling with basic infrastructure.

The question was simple: What if we could change this?

That evening, Navinya Foundation was born. "Navinya" means "new beginning" in Marathi - 
and that's exactly what we set out to create. Not just for individuals, but for entire 
communities.

We started small. Our first scholarship went to Priya, a girl from a farming family who 
scored 92% but couldn't afford engineering college fees. Today, she's in her final year 
with a job offer in hand. Our first women's training batch had just 10 participants. 
Today, over 80 women have completed our programs, and many run their own businesses.

What began as a small initiative has grown into a comprehensive movement for social 
transformation. We now work across 7 key areas - education, women empowerment, rural 
development, child welfare, health, environment, and community building.

But our core belief remains unchanged: every person deserves a chance to realize their 
full potential, regardless of where they were born or what family they come from.
